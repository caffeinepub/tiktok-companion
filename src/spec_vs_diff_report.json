  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all four requirements with comprehensive backend and frontend changes. The backend now enforces publication state by blocking non-admin API calls when unpublished, while the frontend implements publication state checking on all pages except Settings and removes sessionStorage persistence for staff code verification. The republish/unpublish functionality has been properly implemented with separate mutations and proper state management.",
